/**
 * Restores the active VPN proxy connection after device reboot, but only if the user
 * had it running before shutdown (checked via VpnConfigRepository.isVpnRunning() — a
 * saved config alone is not enough, since it stays saved after the user disconnects).
 *
 * On Android 12+, starting the foreground service directly from BOOT_COMPLETED is
 * disallowed by the platform; VpnProxyManager.tryStartForegroundService() catches that
 * and the in-process xray core keeps running without a notification. ApplicationLoader's
 * restore-on-launch path (which runs with normal foreground privileges) re-attempts the
 * foreground service the next time the app process starts, so the notification recovers
 * without user action.
